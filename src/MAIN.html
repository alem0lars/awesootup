<dl>

  <dt>app</dt>
  <dd>Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.</dd>

  <dt>app/admin</dt>
  <dd>Holds the code that's specific to the administration part of the application.</dd>

  <dt>app/assets</dt>
  <dd>Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.</dd>

  <dt>app/controllers</dt>
  <dd>
    Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
    automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
    ApplicationController which itself descends from ActionController::Base.
  </dd>

  <dt>app/models</dt>
  <dd>
    Holds models that should be named like post.rb. Models descend from
    ActiveRecord::Base by default.
  </dd>

  <dt>app/views</dt>
  <dd>
    Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
    weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action.
    All views use eRuby syntax by default.
  </dd>

  <dt>app/views/layouts</dt>
  <dd>
    Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the
    common header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout
    using the <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb.
    Inside default.html.erb, call <% yield %> to render the view using this
    layout.
  </dd>

  <dt>app/helpers</dt>
  <dd>
    Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are
    generated for you automatically when using generators for controllers.
    Helpers can be used to wrap functionality for your views into methods.
  </dd>

  <dt>config</dt>
  <dd>
    Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database,
    and other dependencies.
  </dd>

  <dt>db</dt>
  <dd>
    Contains the database schema in schema.rb. db/migrate contains all the
    sequence of Migrations for your schema.
  </dd>

  <dt>doc</dt>
  <dd>
    This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when
    generated using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>
  </dd>

  <dt>lib</dt>
  <dd>
    Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that
    doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in
    the load path.
  </dd>

  <dt>public</dt>
  <dd>
    The directory available for the web server. Also contains the dispatchers
    and the default HTML files. This should be set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your
    web server.
  </dd>

  <dt>script</dt>
  <dd>Helper scripts for automation and generation.</dd>

  <dt>test</dt>
  <dd>
    Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the rails generate
    command, template test files will be generated for you and placed in this
    directory.
  </dd>

  <dt>vendor</dt>
  <dd>
    External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins
    subdirectory. If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under
    vendor/rails/. This directory is in the load path.
  </dd>
