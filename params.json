All controllers should descend from\r\n  ApplicationController which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\r\n\r\napp/models\r\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb. Models descend from\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base by default.\r\n\r\napp/views\r\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\r\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use\r\n  eRuby syntax by default.\r\n\r\napp/views/layouts\r\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the\r\n  common header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout\r\n  using the <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb.\r\n  Inside default.html.erb, call <% yield %> to render the view using this\r\n  layout.\r\n\r\napp/helpers\r\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are\r\n  generated for you automatically when using generators for controllers.\r\n  Helpers can be used to wrap functionality for your views into methods.\r\n\r\nconfig\r\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database,\r\n  and other dependencies.\r\n\r\ndb\r\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb. db/migrate contains all the\r\n  sequence of Migrations for your schema.\r\n\r\ndoc\r\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when\r\n  generated using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\r\n\r\nlib\r\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that\r\n  doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in\r\n  the load path.\r\n\r\npublic\r\n  The directory available for the web server. Also contains the dispatchers and the\r\n  default HTML files. This should be set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web\r\n  server.\r\n\r\nscript\r\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\r\n\r\ntest\r\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the rails generate\r\n  command, template test files will be generated for you and placed in this\r\n  directory.\r\n\r\nvendor\r\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins\r\n  subdirectory. If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under\r\n  vendor/rails/. This directory is in the load path.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
